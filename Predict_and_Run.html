        Look at each example , study it carefully.
        Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs. Your prediction should be added to the code as comments. You should use the key terms subroutine, call and parameter in your predictions.
        Run the code, compare what happens to your prediction.
        Add comments to note down and differences between your prediction and what actually happened.
